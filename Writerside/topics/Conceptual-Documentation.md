The Dynamic Response Yield Analysis and Decline Simulator (DRYADS) is a powerful tool for predicting the economic and
ecological impacts of Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) on urban forests. 

This process-based Monte Carlo simulator models the growth, health, and key characteristics of individual trees, 
tracking their changes over time under various scenarios.
