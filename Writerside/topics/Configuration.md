# Configuration

Dryad strives to be highly configurable while providing good, research-based default parameters. 

All configurable values are exposed through `.json` files. Currently work is underway to also expose all configuration 
directly in the Dryad Terminal. 

`.json` files are specially formatted text files and can be edited in any text editor. Common examples include Microsoft Notepad, 
GNU Nano, and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). Online editors also exist, such as 
[https://jsonhero.io/](https://jsonhero.io/).
